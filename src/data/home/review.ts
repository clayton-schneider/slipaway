  body: "Just a perfect way to spend a hot afternoon. Bill and Kate were very friendly and welcoming. This is our sendond trip and it left from Wethersfield Cove and headed north towards Hartford. The trip was very informative as we leisurely cruised up the river. Bill and Kate identified various birds and structures along the way. The slight breeze of the boat provided a pleasant cooling effect. Highly recommended!",
